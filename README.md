# Space Shooters

Welcome to Descend Us, the [Among Us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Among_Us) spinoff!


## About the game

Now that you've been [ejected from the spaceship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Among_Us#Gameplay), you must use your parachute to descend back down to Earth.

The catch is: there's asteroids in the way!

You must navigate and dodge the asteroids. You are also given a laser gun to shoot down the asteroids!

You start being 1000km away from Earth, with 100HP and 10 lasers.

Every time you shoot down an asteroid, you get 50km to reaching Earth.

If you just avoid the asteroids without shooting them, you descend at a rate of 1km/sec.

If you get hit by an asteroid, you lose 5HP.

You must grab the laser packs to replenish your laser supply.
